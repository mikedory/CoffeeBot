#CoffeeBot

I wanted to write a campfire bot.  So I did it in CoffeeScript to teach myself a thing or two.  And that's fun!


##Running

	coffee -w main.coffee {\"userToken\":\"[token]\"}


##Credit where credit due (dude)

Lots of this is stolen/learned/swiped from [Jashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script-tmbundle), of course.  Oh and [Pickles](https://github.com/tombell/pickles/tree/master/src) too.
